Modifications to the header file to run with a filename as argument
Run it with runAlpha_T.cc (.x runAlpha_T.cc("sampleName") ) where sampleName.txt is the
file containing the list of files to be processed (attached to the chain)

Be careful the list of files in the crap.txt should end with no empty line
otherwise it thinks there is a new file.

In Steps:

1) |myTerm> root -l
2) root[ ] .x runAlpha_T.cc("sampleName")

Note: Do NOT change the hearer file ("alpha_T.h"). Normally you should
      only change the source file "alpha_T.C" for all the different
      things you want to do during looping over the trees.
