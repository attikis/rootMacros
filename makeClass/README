ROOT allows you to execute C++ code in place of the selection cuts and plotting variables. These
functions can be interpreted by ROOT interactively, or compiled and run (improving execution
speed). You have access to all the utility functions stored in the ROOT libraries as well.
If you want to be able to access variables within your Tree, you need to create a class for the Tree.

--> Start by following detailed instructions found in "makeClass.C" file.
